            <h3>Assessments, Supporting Growth, and Parent/Teacher Conferences</h3>
            <p>
              Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	
              <br><br>
              Teachers keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	development.	Assessment	include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Checklists</li> 
                <li>Timelines</li> 
                <li>Examples of the child's writing and pictures</li> 
               </ul>	
               <br>
               <br>
              
              <p> Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
              in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
              The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
              more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
              time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.</p>
