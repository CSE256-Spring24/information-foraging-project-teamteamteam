        <h1>Philosophy & Values</h1>


        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with their own
          patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and
          encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, playbased curriculum
          built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including
          Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the
          developmental needs of the whole child by:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the
            students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language,
            discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them
          </li>
          <li>
            Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
            senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
            opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
            of peers
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
            listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
            seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills

          </li>
          <li>
            Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
            to become problem solvers

          </li>
          <li>
            Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
            similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
            unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that are developmentally
          appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play. Using a learning
          center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks,
          manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and
          physical developmental needs of each child.
