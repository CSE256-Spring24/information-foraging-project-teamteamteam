        <h1>Philosophy & Values</h1>


        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with their own
          patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and
          encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, playbased curriculum
          built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including
          Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the
          developmental needs of the whole child by:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the
            students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language,
            discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them
          </li>
          <li>
            Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
            senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
            opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
            of peers
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
            listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
            seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills

          </li>
          <li>
            Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
            to become problem solvers

          </li>
          <li>
            Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
            similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
            unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that are developmentally
          appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play. Using a learning
          center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks,
          manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and
          physical developmental needs of each child.

        <h2>How do we assess your child's education?</h2>

        <p>
          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on an ongoing
          basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’ needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways,
          which may include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and
            increase student confidence
          </li>
          <li>
            Offering more opportunities for exploration
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
          </li>
          <li>

            Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration

          </li>
          <li>
            Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage
            different parts of the brain in the learning process
          </li>
          <li>
            Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area
            of concern

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Parent/Teacher Conferences
        </h3>
        <p>
          Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
          students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
          group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
          informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
          and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
          Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
          curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
          child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
          read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
